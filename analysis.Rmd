Interesting questions: competing risks: a lot of people died during covid; at some point we should see a decline in overall death rates below baseline because of this 'harvesting' effect. in which groups will this be most apparent?

Analysis idea; define excess death rate by 5 year age bin. (e.g., simple approach, annual incidence in previous year vs 2020 with trend adjustment; annual deaths; use bayesian model)

Deaths in year y, age group i:
 N_deaths_y_i ~ Poisson (lambda_y_i)
 log(lambda_y_i) = log(pop_y_i) + alpha_i +beta1_i*t + beta2_i*ind2020
 beta1_i ~dnorm(rho1*beta1_(i-1), tau)
